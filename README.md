# PaintPrompt

My current prompt and some random shortcuts. 
Paints your prompt red when in production (and shows some other standard information). 

Put `paint-prompt.zsh` in your home folder and add this bit of code to your `~/.zshrc` to activate.
```bash
source ~/paint-prompt.zsh
init_prompt
```

Requires [OhMyZsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) to work.
